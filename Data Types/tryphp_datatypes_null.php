    // Null is a special data type which can have only one value: NULL.

    // A variable of data type NULL is a variable that has no value assigned to it.

    // Tip: If a variable is created without a value, it is automatically assigned a value of NULL.

    // Variables can also be emptied by setting the value to NULL:

    $x = "Hello world!";
    $x = null;
    $y;
    var_dump($x);
    var_dump($y);
?>
